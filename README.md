# Indian-Stock-Screener
📊 A Python-based Nifty 500 stock screener with 9 modules including RSI, MACD, gap up/down, 52-week high/low, multi-year returns, and more. Uses yfinance, pandas, and mplfinance for data, filtering, and plotting. Ideal for investors, analysts, and learners.


# 🎯 Objective:
To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly stock screener using Python that allows users to analyze Nifty 500 stocks based on various technical and return-based indicators, and generate automated graphs to visually assist in decision-making. The tool uses yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and provides multiple stock filtering strategies for traders, analysts, and investors.


# 📋 Description of Modules

### 1. Strong 5Y Return + Weak 1Y Return (Drawdown) Filter

Purpose: Identify fundamentally strong stocks that have performed well over the last 5 years but are currently in a short-term drawdown. This helps spot potential buying opportunities.

Logic:

Filter stocks where 5Y return ≥ user-defined %
AND 1Y return ≤ user-defined % (e.g., negative or weak return)

Logic:

Download past 2 days' close prices
Compute % change
Show top N gainers or losers
Plot intraday 5-minute chart for each selected stock
