# Indian-Stock-Screener
ðŸ“Š A Python-based Nifty 500 stock screener with 9 modules including RSI, MACD, gap up/down, 52-week high/low, multi-year returns, and more. Uses yfinance, pandas, and mplfinance for data, filtering, and plotting. Ideal for investors, analysts, and learners.


# ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly stock screener using Python that allows users to analyze Nifty 500 stocks based on various technical and return-based indicators, and generate automated graphs to visually assist in decision-making. The tool uses yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and provides multiple stock filtering strategies for traders, analysts, and investors.


# ðŸ“‹ Description of Modules

### 1. Strong 5Y Return + Weak 1Y Return (Drawdown) Filter

### 5. RSI Screener (Overbought/Oversold)

Purpose: Identify stocks that are potentially overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30), based on Relative Strength Index.

Logic:

Calculate 14-day RSI
Filter based on user preference (overbought or oversold)

### 6. Gap Up/Down Screener

Purpose: Detect stocks that opened significantly higher or lower than their previous dayâ€™s close.

Logic:

Compare todayâ€™s opening price to yesterdayâ€™s close
Flag stocks with large upward/downward gap

#  Conclusion
The development of this Nifty 500 Stock Screener project marks a significant step toward the practical application of financial data analysis using Python. This project not only consolidates various technical and return-based indicators into a single, user-friendly tool but also provides visual insights through automated charts, making it a valuable resource for both novice investors and seasoned analysts.

Throughout the project, we leveraged Pythonâ€™s robust data science libraries such as yfinance, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to fetch, clean, analyze, and visualize stock market data efficiently. The screener was built to cover a comprehensive range of modulesâ€”from long-term performance filters like "Strong 5Y Return + Weak 1Y Drawdown" to short-term technical setups such as "MACD Crossovers" and "RSI Extremes." Additionally, features like "Top Daily Gainers/Losers" and the "Gap Up/Down Screener" provide users with real-time momentum-based filtering capabilities.

One of the unique strengths of this tool lies in its visual output generation. For every matching stock in a module, the program automatically generates high-quality graphs and stores them in neatly organized directories. This visual representation greatly enhances the decision-making process, helping users identify trends, patterns, and key price levels at a glance.

Moreover, the project reflects a balanced integration of fundamental return-based metrics and technical indicators, which is essential for developing a well-rounded investment strategy. The modular architecture also makes the tool highly scalableâ€”new features such as Bollinger Bands, PE ratio filters, or volume analysis can be easily added without disrupting existing functionality.

From a technical standpoint, this project improved our understanding of API data extraction, error handling in real-world financial datasets, user interaction through console inputs, and dynamic visualization techniques. It also emphasized the importance of data integrity, directory management, and exception handling to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience.

In conclusion, this stock screener serves as a practical example of how programming and financial analysis can intersect to build intelligent, data-driven tools. It not only reinforces key programming concepts but also enhances analytical thinking from a finance perspective. The flexibility, automation, and depth of insights offered by this tool can empower users to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving stock market. With further refinements and the potential addition of a GUI or web interface, this project can evolve into a full-scale market analytics platform.
